## Data Flow

1. The user at client side sends a request to the application through the API endpoints.
2. The API receives the request and sends it to the appropriate controller method.
3. The controller method makes a call to the method in service class.

4. The method in service class builds logic and retrieves or modifies data from the database, which is in turn given to controller class
5. The controller method returns a response to the API.
6. The API sends the response back to the user.

It serves as a tool to manage stock inventory, allowing users to add, view, update, and delete stock items. 
The application also includes search and filtering functionality to facilitate efficient stock tracking. 
The project structure section provides insights into the organization of the codebase, 
highlighting key files such as the entry point, controller, and model classes. It also mentions the presence of HTML templates for the application's user interface.
